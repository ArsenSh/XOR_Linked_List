# XOR_Linked_List
# We know that each node of a doubly-linked list requires two pointer fields to store its previous and next node’s addresses. On the other hand, each node of the XOR linked list requires only a single pointer field, which doesn’t store the actual memory addresses but stores the bitwise XOR of the address for its previous and next node.
